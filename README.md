The exploration of Armenia's healthcare system proved to be both fascinating and a handful of challenges. In our capstone project, we set the ambitious goal to thoroughly investigate health insurance in Armenia. 

This required us to navigate through a lot of obstacles, however having the clear goal in mind we were able to pass right through these difficulties. Over several months, our team dedicated itself to gathering relevant data, which involved extensive research and collaborations with healthcare insurance companies. Due to all of the effort we were not only able to get the needed data but were successful in the data cleaning stage - another crucial part of the capstone project.

Through our persistent work, we were able to reach the needed results and identify patterns and trends within the data. Our analysis included data visualizations, which were crucial in making the complex information more accessible and understandable. These visualizations were not only instrumental in our analysis but also enhanced our final R shiny dashboard.

The R shiny dashboard are effectively showcasing our findings, allowing us to present our findings in a dynamic and interactive format. The ability to manipulate the visual data in real-time will our audience with a clearer understanding of the health insurance landscape in Armenia. This capstone project is not only showing our analytical and programming skills but also deepens our understanding of Armenia's healthcare system. This was an excellent opportunity to handle real-world data and present it in an impactful, user-friendly manner.

In this report, we will dig deeper into each stage of our capstone projects. We will take a look at how the data was gathered and how it was cleaned and analyzed. We will go over our visualizations and findings, and we'll talk about how the R shiny dashboard was created. 
In this report, we will dig deeper into each stage of our capstone projects, discussing the details of data gathering and cleaning stages, going over the analysis and visualizations, and taking a more detailed look at our findings and the presented dashboard. 

### Considering that our capstone project is done on very private data, which we got based on an NDA contract with the insurance company, our dataset is not going to be published.
